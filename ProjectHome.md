**Open Source Game Framework for Android**

The aim of cloak is to provide a simple framework that anyone can use to create games. You may not able to develop a Quake or Grand Theft Auto clone however you will be able to quickly code that retro arcade game you fell in love with as a child.

Visit the wiki for a list of tutorials, http://code.google.com/p/cloak/w/list. More tutorials will follow in the coming weeks.

Feature requests are welcome and I would love to hear from anyone interested in getting involved with the project.

**Note:** If you are an experienced game developer this may not be suitable, however I would appreciate any feedback you provide.
